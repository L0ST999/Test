                Mental health is a huge issue around the world, we want to make that easier on our members.
                Much of the world suffers from things such as depression and anxiety.
                We try to combat these tribulations by helping eachother out from time to time,
                chatting here and there, and we also make friends along the way. The Admins refrain from abusing power,
                no communism!
